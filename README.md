# Objective:
To provide a tailor made plan consisting of possible places to stay, attractions to visit and restaurants to 
eat at for the entire duration of travel. We recommend restaurants separately for each meal of the day (breakfast, 
lunch and dinner) and provide two recommendations per meal per day. We also recommend five possible stay options (hotels) 
for your travel alongside possible attractions to view. Attractions are recommended based on timing, (i.e) which ones to view 
during the day and which ones are better off at night. Again we provide two attraction recommendations per timing per 
day for the entire duration of travel.
